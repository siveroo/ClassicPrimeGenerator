# ClassicPrimeGenerator
Just a simple Prime Number generator with the classic algorithm.
When it's done generating the primes, you can find the text file in the same folder where you executed this program.

# How it works?
It checks whether if a number (starting from 2) has at least 1 factor that is less than it's square root. If there are no factors other than 1 and the number itself, then it's a prime, add it to the list/text file, check the next number.
